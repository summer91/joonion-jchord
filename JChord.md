# DHT #

**Distributed hash tables (DHTs)** are a class of decentralized distributed systems that provide a lookup service similar to a hash table: (name, value) pairs are stored in the DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given name.

Using the Chord lookup protocol, node keys are arranged in a circle. The circle cannot have more than 2<sup>m nodes. The ring can have ids/keys ranging from 0 to 2</sup>m âˆ’ 1.
